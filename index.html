Karachi is a fast-paced city with a bustling economy, serving as the <b><u><i>"Gateway of Pakistan"</i></u></b>
Karachi[a] is the capital city of the province of Sindh, Pakistan. It is the largest city in Pakistan and <b><u><i>12<sup>th</sup></i></u></b> largest in the world, with a population of over 20 million.[12][18] It is situated at the southern tip of the country along the Arabian Sea coast and formerly served as the country's capital from 1947 to 1959. Ranked as a beta-global city,[19][20] it is Pakistan's premier industrial and financial centre,[21] with an estimated GDP of over $200 billion (PPP) as of 2021.[16][17] Karachi is a major metropolitan area and is considered Pakistan's most cosmopolitan city, and among the country's most linguistically, ethnically, and religiously diverse regions,[22] as well as one of the country's most progressive and socially liberal cities.[23][24]

The region has been inhabited for millennia,[25] but the city was formally founded as the fortified village of Kolachi as recently as 1729.[26][27] The settlement greatly increased in importance with the arrival of the East India Company in the mid-b <b><u><i>19 <sup>th</sup></i></u></b> century. British administrators embarked on substantial projects to transform the city into a major seaport, and connect it with the extensive railway network of the Indian subcontinent.[27] At the time of Pakistan's independence in 1947, the city was the largest in Sindh with an estimated population of 400,000 people, and a slim Hindu majority.[22][28] Following the partition of India, the city experienced a dramatic shift in population and demography with the arrival of hundreds of thousands of Muslim immigrants from India,[29] coupled with an exodus of nearly all of its Hindu residents.[28] The city experienced rapid economic growth following Pakistan's independence, attracting migrants from throughout the country and other regions in South Asia.[30] According to the 2023 Census of Pakistan, Karachi's total population was 20.3 million.[31] Karachi is one of the world's fastest-growing cities,[32] and has significant communities representing almost every ethnic group in Pakistan. Karachi holds more than two million Bengali immigrants, a million Afghan refugees, and up to 400,000 Rohingyas from Myanmar.[33][34][35]

Karachi is now Pakistan's premier industrial and financial centre. The city has a formal economy estimated to be worth $190 billion as of 2021, which is the largest in the country.[36][37] Karachi collects 35% of Pakistan's tax revenue,[38] and generates approximately 25% of Pakistan's entire GDP.[39][40] Approximately 30% of Pakistani industrial output is from Karachi,[41] while Karachi's ports handle approximately 95% of Pakistan's foreign trade.[42] Approximately 90% of the multinational corporations and 100% of the banks operating in Pakistan are headquartered in Karachi.[42] It also serves as a transport hub, and contains Pakistan's two largest seaports, the Port of Karachi and Port Qasim, as well as Pakistan's busiest airport, Jinnah International Airport.[43] Karachi is also considered to be Pakistan's fashion capital,[44][45] and has hosted the annual Karachi Fashion Week since 2009.[46][47]

Known as the <b><u><i>"City of Lights"</i></u></b> in the 1960s and 1970s for its vibrant nightlife,[48] Karachi was beset by sharp ethnic, sectarian, and political conflict in the 1980s with the large-scale arrival of weaponry during the Soviet–Afghan War.[49] The city had become well known for its high rates of violent crime, but recorded crimes sharply decreased following a crackdown operation against criminals, the MQM political party, and Islamist militants, initiated in 2013 by the Pakistan Rangers.[50] As a result of the operation, Karachi dropped from being ranked the world's <b><u><i>6 <sup>th</sup></i></u></b>-most dangerous city for crime in 2014, to <b><u><i>128 <sup>th</sup></i></u></b> by 2022
